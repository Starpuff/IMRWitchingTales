Withcing Tales
--------------

Week 12 progress
---------------
We added more plants to the landscape, added a new terrain, a new sky, and made a menu appear when starting the game, containing some information about the game and a "Start" button. 

Week 7 progress
---------------
For this week we have done a blender model that will be included in the town scene as the witch house. We have also created a prototype for the town scene.
Screenshots of the house and the town scene can be found in the folder "Progress/Week_7".
