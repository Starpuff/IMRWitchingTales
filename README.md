## Withcing Tales

## Week 11 progress

We added the new interior scene of the witch house. Up to the deadline of friday, we worked on the sound effect of knocking at the door after getting out of the bed. The objective is now, to add a button to get out of the house, and to meet with the villagers. Moreover, the cauldron will be added into the scene and a potion making mechanism will be implemented.

## Week 10 progress

We added more plants to the landscape, added a new terrain, a new sky, and made a menu appear when starting the game, containing some information about the game and a "Start" button.

## Week 7 progress

For this week we have done a blender model that will be included in the town scene as the witch house. We have also created a prototype for the town scene.
Screenshots of the house and the town scene can be found in the folder "Progress/Week_7".
